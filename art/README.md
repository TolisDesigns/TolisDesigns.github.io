# How to Add Images to Your Portfolio

## Steps to Upload

1. **Click "Add file"** — Look for the button in the top right corner of this folder
2. **Select "Upload files"** — Choose this option from the dropdown
3. **Drag and drop your images** — You can upload multiple PNG or JPG files at once
4. **Click "Commit changes"** — The green button at the bottom. The commit message doesn't matter
5. **Done!** — Your images will appear on your portfolio site within a few seconds

## File Tips

- **Supported formats:** PNG and JPG/JPEG files
- **Filenames become titles:** If you upload `my-painting.jpg`, it will display as "My Painting" on the site
- **Order your work:** Use numbers at the start of filenames to control the order. For example:
  - `01-featured-work.jpg`
  - `02-landscape.png`
  - `03-portrait.jpg`

That's it! Just upload and commit, and your work will be live on the site.
