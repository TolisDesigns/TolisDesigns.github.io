Drop PNG / JPG files here — the site will automatically show any images placed in this folder.

How it works
- Filename (without extension) is used as the image title.
- Supported file types: .png, .jpg, .jpeg
- Just add or remove files in `/art` (via Git/GitHub) — no code changes required.

Example
- `sunrise-over-city.png` → displays as “Sunrise Over City”

If you want images to appear in a specific order, prefix filenames with numbers: `01-cover.jpg`, `02-portrait.png`.
